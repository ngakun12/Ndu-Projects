# Load necessary libraries

library(tibbletime)  # If you're using time-aware tibbles
library(forecast)    # For time series analysis

# Correctly format the date columns

hospital <- as_tbl_time(hospital, index = Date.of.Admission)

# Now, you can proceed with further analysis, such as summarizing, plotting, or time series forecasting.

# For example, here's a quick look at how you might plot the number of admissions over time:
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(hospital, aes(x = Date.of.Admission)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Number of Admissions Over Time",
       x = "Date of Admission",
       y = "Count of Admissions")

# Ensure the 'forecast' library is loaded and you proceed with time series analysis as intended.

# Load necessary libraries

# Assuming the dataset is named 'hospital'
# Ensure Date.of.Admission is a Date type

# Aggregate data by Date.of.Admission to get daily admissions count
admissions_daily <- hospital %>%

  summarise(Count = n())

# Convert to time series object, assuming daily data that needs to be analyzed monthly
admissions_ts <- ts(admissions_daily$Count, frequency = 12, start = c(year(min(hospital$Date.of.Admission)), month(min(hospital$Date.of.Admission))))

# Plot the time series
plot(admissions_ts, main = "Monthly Admissions Count", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Count")

# Decompose the time series to observe components
decomposed_ts <- decompose(admissions_ts)
plot(decomposed_ts)

# Check for stationarity
adf.test(admissions_ts, alternative = "stationary")
